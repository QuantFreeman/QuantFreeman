# Sasha Morrison: Data Scientist :space_invader:
I'm a recent graduate of Concordia's Data Science bootcamp
During the 2020 lockdown in Montreal I made the decision to pursue my passion for min/maxing!

### What do I do?
I'm currently most capable working in Python, with emphasis in Jupyter Notebooks as seen in my repositories.
Anything that allows me to get my hands on tabular data is within my domain.

My bootcamp focused heavily on Pandas and I'm at home manipulating locs & joins to find and expose novel insights. 
As an SQL jockey I'm still a novice but I feel comfortable building functional to intermediate queries, and I'm getting better all the time.

### What sets me apart?
My entry into the world of data came about as a culmination of a 27 years of following my passions. I was (and currently am) a bike courier by trade and before that was working in lighting for feature films.

I believe that the diversity of skillsets in my background have resulted in well-rounded and highly practical problem solving mentality that converts seamlessly into my data science methodologies.

### What's next?
I'm taking on a new project currently in which I'm learning Javascript & Node.js for the purpose of integrasting the APIs of two partnered businesses in Montreal.

I'm continuing the read widely and learn about the state of the art in machine & deep learning, I'm eager to get a sense of where the line is between needing ML vs DL in order to deploy efficient and meaningful solutions.

I'm looking to mature my data workflow by learning PySpark (yay for more Pandas:panda_face:) and Databricks! If you have any resources to share please send them my way.

### Thanks for stopping by!
I'll be active here if you wanna keep up with my work please feel free to watch this space, I'm open to collaborate if you have a project to discuss please feel free to reach me at QuantFreeman@gmail.com
